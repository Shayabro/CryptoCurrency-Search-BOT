# CryptoCurrency-Search-BOT
This project is for my final project in Economics. 
I made a BOT that scans the /r/CryptoCurrency subreddit of Reddit.
The main goal is to make a hypothesis regarding the relation between: 
  *The number of mentions that a Crypto Currency has in a day*
  AND
  *The traded value (in USD) of a Crypto Currency after several days*

Currently the time interval for checking this hypothesis is hardened inside the code, and it is set up for June 2021.
This property is changable and the hypothesis might be executed over any wished period of time.
